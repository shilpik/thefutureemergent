  <div class="title"> DEAR PAST KYTANA, </div>

  <div class="longtext">
Remember that dream you had in college about holding your younger self as she cried? She was all alone on some playground in Belgium sobbing. She was so devastated about what could have been anything and everything, which is an emotional state we’ve been grappling with for what seems like forever. So instinctually we rushed to young kytana and embraced her with a fierce tightness. We then began to cry just as hard as she was because we intrinsically understood how she was feeling. The dream began to breakdown at this point but I think we said something like ”I’m right here, I see you and things will get better” into her brightly barrette covered pigtails because we knew that’s what we would have wanted to hear in that very moment.   <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
So, I write this letter in hopes of doing the same thing we did for our younger dream self. I’m here kytana, I see you and things will get better. I don’t have to recount to you some of the things we’ve fought through to get to this point in life. They are times we rather not dwell on but I am here to tell you that we will deal with the 2020 COVID-19 Pandemic the same way we’ve always have and emerge scathed but standing.   <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
You’re going to find solace and renewed energy in the foundational sandbox that is your collages. Your intent will still be focused on creating alternate realities in where the black female form can be a symbol of exploration, knowledge, peace, ingenuity, and innovation. And on the border scope, you will still be thinking of ways to affirm that the essence of Afrofuturism is attainable. Our Pan-African Diaspora just has to continue to dream big, cherish the planet, and look up at the stars of the universe for the courage to be more than a stereotype.   <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
I’d be full shit if I said this was the end of our trials and tribulations for both us and humanity, but just remember to continue to dream wonderful lush worlds in spite of everything.
2020 is not your end and nor is it the worlds.   <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
Yours wholeheartedly,   <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
Future Kytana   <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
P.S Here is a song recommendation to ease your mind. Is it too cheeky to say I already know you’re going to love it?   <div class="smallspacer"> </div>
